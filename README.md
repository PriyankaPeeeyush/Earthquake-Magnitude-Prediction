# Earthquake-Magnitude-Prediction

Developed earthquake magnitude prediction model using
United States Geological Survey (USGS) data.
Predicted magnitudes at locations based on latitude, longitude,
depth, rms, gap.
Classified predictions as light, moderate, strong, or major
Richter scale categories.
Explored data, pre-processed, and compared algorithms (RF,
XGBoost, Extra Trees, Linear Regression).
XGBoost achieved highest accuracy at 94.26%.
