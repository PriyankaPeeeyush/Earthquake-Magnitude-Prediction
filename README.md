# Earthquake-Magnitude-Prediction

Given historical seismic data and other relevant features such as location, depth, and time of occurrences, the task is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast the magnitude of future of earthquakes. The model should take into account the complex and non-linear relationships between the various factors that contribute to seismic activity.
The goal is to predict the magnitude of earthquake in certain location given the latitude, longitude, depth of that location and classify them into light, moderate, strong and major according to the Richterâ€™s scale.
